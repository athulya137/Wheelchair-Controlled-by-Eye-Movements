The wheelchair control system combines the Arduino UNO R4 Minima, L298N Motor Driver, gear motors, and HC-05 Bluetooth module to provide smooth, precise navigation for users with mobility impairments. The Python-based software interface, built with Tkinter and OpenCV, supports both eye-tracking and a GUI, offering versatile control options. Twilio SMS integration further enhances user safety. This modular design is easily customizable to individual needs and future upgrades.
